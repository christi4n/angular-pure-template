# PureTemplate

This project is taken from a free HTM5 template called "Pure" and transformed to the Angular way. It's like a sandbox. You can use it to build new Angular projects. It will be occasionally updated to fit the Angular best practices and to be compatible with the next Angular versions.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.

## Npm

You can run `npm install` before `ng serve` to install dependencies for this package.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
